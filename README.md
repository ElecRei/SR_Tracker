Tracks skill rating gains and losses for Overwatch

**Date started**: *9/21/2017*


## Purpose

The team I plays with knows how to calculate their SR gains and losses in their head but unfortunately I'm not the best with mental math at high speeds. So I wanted to make a tool where you input your current SR and then input your SR after a match and it will calculate for you. I also want to include a visual representaion of the calculation to kind of help those who aren't great at mental math improve that skill.

As a start it will be a simple static calculator that won't save any data the user inputs once they close the browser but I do want to work towards implementing a database to save the values. I also want to build a graph feature so the user can see a visual representation of their competitive growth.

That's it for now because if I keep going I'll add too many things to this project and not finish it.
